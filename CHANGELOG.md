# Changelog

#### 0.22.0 - 2021-12-15

- reduced filtering for object keys (#88)
- updated to `jsonschema >= 4.0.0` (#89);
  though support for `Draft 2019-09` and `2020-12` will take longer

  specify a strategy to generate strings for custom formats like credit card numbers.
  Thanks to Dmitry Dygalo, whose [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/Zac-HD)
  motivated me to add the feature!

#### 0.16.2 - 2020-07-12
- Substantial performance gains for some schemas, via improved handling of the
  `contains`, `not`, `anyOf`, and `if/then/else` keywords

#### 0.16.1 - 2020-06-15
- Performance improvement for `object` schemas with `additionalProperties: false` (issue #55)

#### 0.16.0 - 2020-06-07
- Performance improvement for schemas with non-validation keys (such as `description`)
- Errors from e.g. invalid schemas are deferred from import time to become failing tests
- Improved handling for some schemas with overlapping non-integer `multipleOf` keys

#### 0.15.1 - 2020-06-05
- Significantly improved efficiency of certain `patternProperties` schemas.

#### 0.15.0 - 2020-06-04
- Fixed several bugs related to interactions between `properties`, `patternProperties`,
  and `additionalProperties`.  As a result some strategies will be more efficient than
  before and others less; and further gains seem likely.

#### 0.14.0 - 2020-06-01
- Improved strategy for `json-pointer` and `relative-json-pointer` string formats
- Improved generation of arrays with rarely-satisfied `contains` constraints
- Improved canonicalisation and merging of `allOf` schemas

#### 0.13.1 - 2020-05-22
- Performance improvement in calculating schema intersections

#### 0.13.0 - 2020-05-20
- Improved canonicalisation of `uniqueItems: false` case
- Improved canonicalisation of numeric schemas
- Reuse `jsonschema` validators during canonicalisation (performance improvement)

#### 0.12.1 - 2020-04-14
- Added a strategy for the `"color"` format
- Only apply string length filter when needed (small performance improvement)

#### 0.12.0 - 2020-04-08
- Fixed error in resolution of certain `$ref`\ s
- Improved canonicalisation of `anyOf` and `contains` keys

#### 0.11.1 - 2020-01-27
- Requires Hypothesis >= 5.3.0, for improved IP address strategies
- Better canoncialisation of array schemata

#### 0.11.0 - 2020-01-26
- Resolve local, non-recursive references via the `$ref` keyword.

This is the largest feature in a while, and for some schemata it is a breaking
change.  It's also a fundamental part of the spec, so I'm OK with that!

Note that `hypothesis-jsonschema` will raise an explicit error rather than fetching
a remote resource via URI.  If think your tests *really should* hit the network,
get in touch and we can discuss adding an off-by-default option for this.

#### 0.10.3 - 2020-01-26
- Improved canonicalisation of conflicting `minProperties` and `maxProperties`
- Explictly reject draft-03 schemata, which are not supported
- More specific type annotations for `from_schema`
- Better performance for certain object schemata

#### 0.10.2 - 2020-01-09
- `enum` schema now shrink to a minimal example rather than the first value listed.
  This also makes the internals more efficient in certain rare cases.
- Improved handling of bounded numeric sub-schemas

#### 0.10.1 - 2019-12-28
- Improved handling of non-integer numeric schemas with `multipleOf`
- Improved handling of `not` in many common cases
- Improved handling of object schemas with `dependencies` on required keys
- Fixed cases where `propertyNames` bans a `required` key

#### 0.10.0 - 2019-12-26
- Improved handling of numeric schemas, especially integer schemas with `multipleOf`.
- Bump the minimum version of Hypothesis to ensure that all users have the unique
  array bugfix from `0.9.12`.
- Fixed a bug where array schemas with an array of `items`, `additionalItems: false`,
  and a `maxItems` larger than the number of allowed items would resolve to an
  invalid strategy.

#### 0.9.13 - 2019-12-18
- Improved internal handling of schemas for arrays which must always be length-zero.

#### 0.9.12 - 2019-12-01
- Fixed RFC 3339 strings generation.  Thanks to Dmitry Dygalo for the patch!
- Fixed a bug where equal floats and ints could be generated in a unique array,
  even though JSONSchema considers 0 === 0.0
  (though this may also require an upstream fix to work...)

#### 0.9.11 - 2019-11-30
- Fixed a bug where objects which could have either zero or one
  properties would always be generated with zero.

#### 0.9.10 - 2019-11-27
- Updated project metadata and development tooling
- Supported and tested on Python 3.8

#### 0.9.9 - 2019-10-02
- Correct handling of `{"items": [...], "uniqueItems": true"}` schemas

#### 0.9.8 - 2019-08-24
- Corrected handling of the `"format"` keyword with unknown values - custom values
  are allowed by the spec and should be treated as annotations (i.e. ignored).

#### 0.9.7 - 2019-08-15
- Improved canonicalisation, especially for deeply nested schemas.

#### 0.9.6 - 2019-08-02
- A performance optimisation for null and boolean schema,
  which relies on a bugfix in `jsonschema >= 3.0.2`.

#### 0.9.5 - 2019-08-02
- Improved handling of the `contains` keyword for arrays

#### 0.9.4 - 2019-07-01
- Improved canonicalisation and merging for a wide range of schemas,
  which as usual unlocks significant optimisations and performance
  improvements for cases where they apply.

#### 0.9.3 - 2019-06-13
- Future-proofed canonicalisation of `type` key.

#### 0.9.2 - 2019-05-23
- Better internal canonicalization, which makes current and future
  optimisations more widely applicable.
- Yet another fix, this time for negative zero and numeric bouds as floats
  with sub-integer precision.  IEEE 754 is *tricky*, even with Hypothesis!
- Fixes handling of `enum` with elements disallowed by base schema,
  handling of `if-then-else` with a base schema, and handling of regex
  patterns that are invalid in Python.

#### 0.9.1 - 2019-05-22
- Fix the fix for numeric schemas with `multipleOf` and exclusive bounds.

#### 0.9.0 - 2019-05-21
- Supports merging schemas for overlapping `patternProperties`,
  a significant performance improvement in most cases.
- If the `"type"` key is missing, it is now inferred from other keys
  rather than always defaulting to `"object"`.
- Fixed handling of complicated numeric bounds.

#### 0.8.2 - 2019-05-21
- Improve performance for object schemas where the min and max size can be
  further constrained from `properties` and `propertyNames` attributes.

#### 0.8.1 - 2019-03-24
- Supports draft-04 schemata with the latest version of `jsonschema`

#### 0.8.0 - 2019-03-23
- Further improved support for `allOf`, `oneOf`, and `anyOf` with base schemata
- Added support for `dependencies`
- Handles overlapping `patternProperties`

#### 0.7.0 - 2019-03-21
- Now requires `jsonschema` >= 3.0
- Improved support for `allOf`, `oneOf`, and `propertyNames`
- Supports schemata with `"type": [an array of types]`
- Warning-free on Hypothesis 4.11

#### 0.6.1 - 2019-02-23
- Fix continuous delivery configuration (*before* the latent bug manifested)

#### 0.6.0 - 2019-02-23
- Support for conditional subschemata, i.e. the `if`, `then`, `else` keywords,
  and the `anyOf`, `allOf`, `oneOf`, and `not` keywords.

#### 0.5.0 - 2019-02-22
- Works with `jsonschema` 3.0 pre-release
- Initial support for draft06 and draft07

#### 0.4.2 - 2019-02-14
- Dropped dependency on `canonicaljson`
- Less warnings on Python 3.7

#### 0.4.1 - 2019-02-06
- Relicensed under the more permissive Mozilla Public License, like Hypothesis
- Requires Hypothesis version 4.0 or later
- Fixed an array bounds bug with `maxItems` and `contains` keywords

#### 0.4.0 - 2018-11-25
Supports string formats (email, datetime, etc) and simple use of the
`"contains"` keyword for arrays.

#### 0.3.0 - 2018-11-25
Good support for all basic types.  MVP.

#### 0.2.0 - 2018-11-24
Inference for null, boolean, string, and numeric types.

#### 0.1.0 - 2018-11-21
Stake in the ground (generate arbitrary JSON and filter it!)
